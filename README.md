# Twitter-Analysis
Extracted Tweets from twitter about the following companies: Apple, Samsung and Huawei

Tweets were gathered using the Twitter API about the companies Apple, Samsung and Huawei. All three companies are big players in the mobile phone industry, my main aim was to find out the opinions twitter users have on all three companies. 

In the process of my analysis, I developed a Word Cloud, a bar char that displays the devices the users use and the countries the tweets are coming from. Finally sentiment analysis was performed to find out if Twitter users have a good or bad view on all three companies.
